             By estimating 3D shape and instances from a single view, we can capture information about an environment
            quickly, without the need for comprehensive scanning and multi-view fusion. Solving this task for composite
            scenes (such as object stacks) is challenging: occluded areas are not only ambiguous in shape but also in
            instance segmentation; multiple decompositions could be valid. We observe that physics constrains
            decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes
            built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded
            regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on
            a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a centre
            voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of
            objects in the scene. At test time, our model can generate 3D shape and instance segmentation from a single
            depth view, probabilistically sampling proposals for the occluded region from the learned latent space.

        <h2>Towards fast object-level scene understanding with approximate reasoning for occluded regions</h2>
           <hr>
        <p>

            The classical approach to generate 3D shapes from depth images involves taking images from all sides of an
            object and fusing the re-projected points into a common 3D representation such as
            a truncated signed distance function (TSDF). This requires comprehensive scanning and still won't guarantee
            that all required viewpoints for a watertight surface reconstruction can be reached.
            Reconstructing the full 3D shape becomes particularly challenging for compositional scenes in which objects
            occlude each other.

            Shape reconstruction is important for scene understanding, estimating free space and can be useful for tracking,
            but in order to allow for interactive tasks such as object manipulation, an object-level understanding of
            the scene is crucial; this requires instance segmentation. With SIMstack we propose the first approach to
            provide both 3D shape and instance decomposition for multiple stacked objects from a
            single depth view.  Our model reconstructs and segments the visible regions with high fidelity while generating shape and instance
            proposals for occluded regions, conditioned on the visible information about the scene.
            This allows for fast reconstruction and decomposition in the visible area and fast approximate object-level reasoning for the occluded areas.

            Our approach is furthermore designed to work for unknown objects, by providing class-agnostic instance segmentation.

           We learn a joint lower dimensional instance and shape encoding by training on a dataset of object stacks,
            generated under physics simulation. At test time, this learnt latent space is used within our depth-conditioned
            VAE to generate shape and instance decomposition in occluded regions. The extracted depth feature maps
            are used to generate accurate 3D shape for the visible region, while conditioning the generated 3D shape
            and instance decomposition of the stack.

        Sampling from the VAE's latent space generates a variety of 3D shape and instance decomposition proposals
        in the scene's occluded region, while keeping the 3D shape in the visible region constant.
